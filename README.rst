Sailfish-fash-fosh: a simple tic-tac-toe game for Sailfish
==========================================================

I thought it would be good to learn myself some mobile programming, so I downloaded the Sailfish SDK and messed around for a few hours. This is what I got.

Here are some resources that I found helpful while making this:

http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/qtquick-tutorials-samegame-samegame1-example.html
http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qml-anchor-layout.html
http://thpmaemo.blogspot.com/2013/03/porting-harmattan-apps-to-sailfish.html
http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/gettingstartedqml.html

I still know approximately zero about Qt and even less about Sailfish, so feedback heartily solicited.
